* window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)
	- callback is the function to call when it's time to update the animation
	  for the next repaint
	- returns an integer value (the request ID) that uniquely identifies the
	  entry in the callback list --> seems like it increases by 1 every call
	- helps us keep calling the drawDot function so we don't have to keep clicking
* window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
	- passing in request ID cancels the refresh callback request
	- used to pop off existing frames from the stack
	- stops the animation from running
	- helps us prevent user from calling the animation too many times
* commenting out beginPath() left a weird black path and it looks like as if the canvas wasn't cleared
