K11 -- Some Things Never Change
2021-10-06

- app.py is the same as the one in v4.
- static files are used for unchanging things like making a resource available (research papers). 
Ex: a page where nothing like the user's name is displayed as it changes between users.
- app.py has access to the static folder.
- viewing the page source just displays the contents of the file.

- Predictions: accessing foo via http://localhost:5000/static/foo would print its contents on the webpage.
- Results: there is a pop up window about opening and saving foo. It does this because foo has no extension. 
When you open the file in a text editor it would be the same as foo.
"which is: DMS file" shows up on mac. "which is: application/octet-stream" shows up on linux. 
The file will be downloaded if you choose to save it.

- Predictions: accessing foo.html via http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html would 
print out its content on the webpage as HTML code does.
- Results: "Is this plaintext, though?" appears on the webpage.

 Is foo.html plaintext, though?
 - Yes it is. Because when we cat it, it shows what is inside the file.
 The reason why it behaves differently than foo is because the how the
 content of the file is in page source and if you have html there you
 you would get the text to display on the website.
- If .txt is added to the end of foo, a download for foo is not prompted but
instead, the contents of the text file are displayed on the webpage. The site 
seems to respond differently to different file extensions.
