AGGREGATION FRAMEWORK
- Another way to query data in MongoDB
- db.<collection>.aggregate([
{ $<operator>: {<field>: <value>}},
])
  [] means arrays which means the order of actions matter --> multiple filters
- db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
                                  { "$match": { "amenities": "Wifi" } },
                                  { "$project": { "price": 1,
                                                  "address": 1,
                                                  "_id": 0 }}]).pretty()
 

Find all documents that have Wifi as one of the amenities. Only include price and address in the resulting cursor
- db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
                                  { "$match": { "amenities": "Wifi" } },
                                  { "$project": { "price": 1,
                                                  "address": 1,
                                                  "_id": 0 }}]).pretty()
Using the aggregation framework find all documents that have Wifi as one of the amenities. Only include price and address in the resulting cursor
- $group #computes and reshapes data by categorizing them
  { $group:
  {
  <field>" { <accumulator> : <expression> },
  } }

- sort({<field>: 0 or 1}) #gets all the documents and returns them in increasing order
- limit() #the amount of documents you want
- Mongo always assumes the order of sort and then limit

INDEXES
- db.<collection>.createIndex( { <field>: <value> } ) #single index
- db.<collection>.createIndex( { <field>: <value>, <field1>: <value1> } ) #compound index

DATA MODELING
- a way to organize fields in a document to support your application performance and querying capabilities
- DATA IS STORED IN THE WAY THAT IT IS USED

UPSERT - Update or Insert?
- db.<collection>.updateOne( {<query to locate>}, {<update>}, {"upsert": true} )
- upsert : true =-> conditional updates
- upsert : false
    - a match = update the matched document
    - no match = insert a new document
