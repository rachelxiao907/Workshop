* For every new statements we put in the dev console, the dev console has all of
  the code statements stored because ENVIRONMENT
* We can have a function as a key-value pair in a dictionary
  ex: o["func"](3)
      o["func"] accesses the function which is the value of the key "func"
      3 is the parameter
 * A dictionary is an object so there are many built in functions in JS for it
   like toString
   ex: o["toString"]() -> [object Object]
  	* We can rewrite these default functions by creating a new key-value pair
  	  with the same function name in the dictionary
