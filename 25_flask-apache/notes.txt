K25 -- Apache, Jump On It
2022-01-18
time spent: 

- When cloning the app onto the server, we had to use the HTTPS link because the SSH link stated
  that we couldn't be authenticated. Not sure what is wrong with the SSH key.
- Is renaming app.py to __init__.py really important to deploying the Flask app on Apache?
- Have to install virtual environment and create one with Flask installed on it.
- sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/FlaskApp.conf
  Creates a virtual host and .conf file
- Before enabling the virtual host with sudo a2ensite FlaskApp, we have to run 
	systemctl reload apache2
- When creating the the wsgi file, we had to do 
	touch flaskapp.wsgi
  before going to chmod +x flaskapp.wsgi
- When restarting the apache server, we ran into an error that said "Job for apache2.service failed
  because the control process exited with error code"
- We noticed that something was wrong with our Apache, so we rebuilt the server and set up
  everything again
