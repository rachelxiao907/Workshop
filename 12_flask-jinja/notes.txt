Predictions:
- The title of the page (the name of the tab) will be {{ foo }} where foo is equal to fooooo.
- The body of the file looks like a for loop from Python which iterates through a collection of items.
- Serving the app on localhost will display each value of the list coll = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8].
- The values inside the {{}} may be replaced when you give inputs to the template.
- Q0: We think that the terminal will print an error that app.py is missing a template module.
- Q1: https://localhost:5000/my_foist_template/model_tmplt.html
- Q2: The first argument of render_template accesses the template model_tmplt.html.
