K12: ...or The Only Constant is Change?
2021-10-07

Observations:
model_tmplt.html
- This file is in a templates folder. This seems similar to the static folder where files in it
will serve a particular function. The app file seems to automatically know that the templates
folder exists.
- The body of the file looks like a for loop from Python which iterates through a collection of
items and has an ending {} to stop the loop.
- What do the % symbols signify?
- What is the difference between {{ and {% ?

app.py
- The values inside the {{}} may be replaced when you give inputs to the app.


Predictions:
- Running app.py on localhost will display the title of the page (the name of the tab) as
{{ foo }} where foo is equal to fooooo.
- Running the app on localhost will display each value of the list coll = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8] on a
new line.


Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
We think that the terminal will print an error that app.py is missing a template module.
There is actually a name error for render_template where it is not defined because 
we call that function later on but do not import it.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
The first argument of render_template() accesses the file model_tmplt.html in the templates
folder. The second and third arguments are the variables in that template file being assigned to
a certain value. It seems that the app.py file can access variables (formatted within {{ }}) from the template file it is
rendering.
