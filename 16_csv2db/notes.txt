CSV Module:
- Dict.Reader() creates a list where the values in the first row are the keys and the other data are
the values of its corresponding key.
- Reader creates a list for each row. For every new piece of data in a row, it is stored at a new
index in the list.
- References: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

SQLITE:
- sqlite <file_name> allows us to create a shell in the terminal that accesses a database. We can
use .quit to get out of the shell.
- We learned that the shell displayes ...> when it thinks that we are continuing a line of code. To end code statements, we need to use semicolons.
- SQL makes it easy to access specific information using column names.
- It seems like the SQL table is ordering the table by the PRIMARY KEY.
- Use PRIMARY to identify the uniqueness of the row in the table. This is the identifier that should be different for each row.
- When we have INTEGER PRIMARY KEY as a type for a table and we try to open the database file after
it's created, we received a "sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: courses.id" So what 
exactly can PRIMARY KEYs be used for?
- We noticed that the commands have to be Strings so we used concatenation when using the INSERT
method.

----------------------------------------------------------
Relational database
 
DB that stores information as a collection of tables.

FIELD: Column data in a RDB

RECORD: Row in a RDB
 
Data can be linked between tables based on field values.

SQL (Structured Query Language)

Standard language designed to work with relational dbs.
 
used for many major db programs, though implementations
 may not (mostly are not) be compatible.

eg, some implementations:
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, IBM DB2, Sybase, M$ Access, ... 



SQLite 
 
SQL implementation that relies entirely on function
 calls in the parent program. (no db server)
  
All db info stored in a single file.
  
Data is dynamically typed as values are inserted.



Basic SQLite Operations:
 
CREATE TABLE
  Add a table to a database 
eg,   
CREATE TABLE <name> (<column name> <data type>, ...)
   
data type will help to convert entered values to a suggested type.

data types:    
TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, NUMERIC, BLOB
     
NUMERIC will default to an integer, but can be a floating point.
     
BLOB means no suggested type.



Columns can be given a PRIMARY KEY attribute,
 denoting that every entry in that column is unique
 and cannot be NULL. 
    
Columns can be given a NOT NULL attribute, 
 denoting that no entry can be NULL.



INSERT INTO
  
Insert a record into a table.
   
INSERT INTO <tbl_name> VALUES ( <field 1>, <field 2> ...)
   
Will add a record to a table matching the values
 to the columns in order.
    
NULL can be used in any entry


eg,
CREATE TABLE tpotusa
 (name TEXT, id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
 INSERT INTO tpotusa VALUES ("basitar", 2);
 INSERT INTO tpotusa VALUES ("guitbass", 1);
 INSERT INTO tpotusa VALUES ("drums", 0);





eg,
CREATE TABLE amunals
 (name TEXT, id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
 INSERT INTO amunals VALUES ("whose-it", 2);
 INSERT INTO amunals VALUES ("whats-it", 1);
 INSERT INTO amunals VALUES ("blurb", 0);



SELECT * FROM <tbl_name>;
   Show all fields for
         each entry (record) in table tbl_name

eg,
SELECT * FROM tpotusa;
SELECT name FROM tpotusa;

eg,
SELECT name FROM tpotusa WHERE id = 0;




SQLite shell is your friend.
Use like IDLE or Python shell to interact live, test, etc.


$ sqlite3 <dbfilename>




shell cmds begin with a dot



some useful SQLITE Shell commands:
  .quit
  .tables
  .header on|off
  .mode column|csv|list|html|insert|line|tabs
  .help




a Python script for interacting with an SQLite db:
import sqlite3 #enable SQLite operations

#open db if exists, otherwise create
db = sqlite3.connect("foo") 

c = db.cursor() #facilitate db ops

c.execute("CREATE TABLE roster(name TEXT,
           userid INTEGER)")

db.commit() #save changes
db.close()
