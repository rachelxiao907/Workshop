The meta viewport tag in head makes it so the website is automatically adjusted based on the size of the device.

To style a button, you just add a btn class to the tag and a btn-[type] class to give it a color.
The button types are: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, and link.
You can also instead add the btn-outline-[type] class for outline buttons instead.
Adding a btn-lg or btn-sm class will make the button large or small respectively.

Bootstrap has many classes that has built in CSS which makes the website look very nice. However,
some of the classes have odd names that are hard to remember.
