DISCO:
There is a lot of overlap in what Boostrap and Foundation has to offer in terms of styling,
though this shouldn't really be a surprise as they are meant to do similar things.
Foundation has grids which is similar to Bootstrap's column layouts.

QCC:
Foundation seems more "boxy" compared to Bootstrap, and a little plain by default.
Bootstrap's default font also looks a bit nicer (though this is completely subjective).
Foundation's colors seem a little less vibrant compared to Bootstrap's.
Foundation's classes are much easier to use, however, since they are less verbose compared
to Bootstrap's.

Q0:
There wasn't really anything in the on-ramp about how to add margins to the main content of
the page, since by default it smushes everything to the left edge.
The CDN included in the on-ramp seems to be outdated, as some of the newer classes
didn't work.

Q1:
We prefer Bootstrap because it has better automatic styling than Foundation does. We are
satisfied with Bootstrap's look without being concerned with the CSS, but Foundation displays
elements that we want to improve with CSS. For example, cards in Bootstrap are automatically
sized and has a border while cards in Foundation just looks like text laid out in a certain way.
