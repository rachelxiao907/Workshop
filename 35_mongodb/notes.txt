- The MongoDB Database doesn't use related tables of data (SQL does) to store and access data
    - stores data in an organized way, but NOT in rows or columns
    - NoSQL documentDB --> data is stored as documents (stores data as a set of field-value pairs)
	- a field is a unique identifier for a specific datapoint (must have a value)
    - documents are stored in collections of of documents
- MongoDB Atlas users can deploy clusters (groups of servers that store your data)
- Atlas is a MongoDB service that can work with any database
    - these servers are configured in a replica set (a few connected MongoDB instances or machine that store the same data)
	- ensures that data will remain will remain intact even if something happens to one of the machinese 
    - instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software (ex: MongoDB Database run in the cloud)
    - Services: cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment
