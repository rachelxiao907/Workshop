Lorem ipsum from https://www.lipsum.com/

Child tags inherit the styling of parent tags unless they have default styles that override them.
For example, header tags have a default margin value so even if a parent tag has
margin: 0, the header tags will still have the default margins.

To remove the underline on anchor (link) tags, you have to add the property "text-decoration: none;"

Unordered and ordered list tags have a list-style property and a left padding by default.

Flexbox is very convenient for organizing the div containers but how can we make columns without it?
