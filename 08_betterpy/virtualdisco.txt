-- The What:
A Python virtual environment is a self-contained installation of Python that can store it's own
local installations of modules (can be used to run different versions of Python).

-- The How:
The following command:
`$ python3 -m venv [directory]`
will create a Python virtual environment located at the given directory, with the same version of Python as the one used to run the command.

To run the virtual environment use
`$ [directory]\Scripts\activate.bat`
if on Windows, and
`$ source tutorial-env/bin/activate`
on Unix and MacOS

-- The Observations
The command created a new folder called myherozero in the home directory.
There are 3 folders and a pyvenv.cfg file that tells you the version of Python you're using.
The bin folder has normal tools for Python like pip for installing packages.
The include folder is empty and can be used for files related to building C extentions.
The lib folder has site-packages locations for installing packages.

-- The Why:
Often, a Python project requires a specific version of a module to be used in order to work.

Creating a virtual environment with its own local modules means that for two different projects,
you aren't forced to use the global installation of a module, and can use two different versions
of the same module for the two projects. You update each virtual environment separately to not affect other installations.
