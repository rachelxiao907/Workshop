-- The What:
A Python virtual environment is a self-contained installation of Python that can store it's own local installations of modules (can be used to run different versions of Python).

-- The How:
The following command:
`$ python3 -m venv [directory]`
will create a Python virtual environment located at the given directory, with the same version of Python as the one used to run the command.

To run the virtual environment use
`$ [directory]\Scripts\activate.bat`
if on Windows, and
`$ source tutorial-env/bin/activate`
on Unix and MacOS

-- The Why:
Often, a Python project requires a specific version of a module to be used in order to work.

Creating a virtual environment with its own local modules means that for two different projects, you aren't forced to use the global installation of a module, and can use two different versions of the same module for the two projects. You update each virtual environment separately to not affect other installations.
