K14 -- Form and Function
2021-10-14

TEMPLATE
Observations:
- In a form tag, you can put an action="/path" which runs the python code that uses the same route. The path is where the webpage will redirect you after submitting the form
- Forms let you send data to somewhere!!
- Input tags have types. The type "text" allows you to submit text and the type "submit" lets click a button to send data to a server. Input tags also have names which could be the name of the data input. The name attribute allows you to access it elsewhere (in the backend)

Predictions:
- A space to type in your username and a submit button appears.
- When the user submits the form, the function authenticate() will run because they use the same app.route to /auth. (AFTER SUBMITTING, THE USER IS BROUGHT TO THE AUTHENTICATION PAGE http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth)

APP
Observations:
- The terminal prints empty data lists or dictionaries(?)  that is filled after the user submits the form due to the request functions.
- The login page is the home page that uses the login template. The authentication page is another page that goes to /auth and only returns a string.

Predictions: 
- The user will see the "Waaaa hooo HAAAH" message, once the user submits the form asking for their username. (THIS IS TRUE) --> we will change the authenticate() function to render a template so the app will respond with a good page
- When the app is run, the disp_loginpage() function will display data about the app file and the input data of the user from the form.
