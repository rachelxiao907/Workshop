Step 0: Notes on Individual Codes
- multiply by 10 = no decimals
- str(<list>) turns the list into a string (type-casting)
- random.choices seems like the best way to select the occupation
- looping through dict.items() allows us to access a dictionary's keys and values

Notable Things:
- through this homework, we got a better understanding of accessing data from dictionaries
- we still don't know exactly how to add another value to a key and how to access a specific
value of a key

EGO:
- egoless programming helps us detect errors, create clearer and more understandable code, eliminate inefficient code (which is more efficient in the long-run), and increases the competence of the group coders
- teaches the people who read the code because they have to understand it to critique it
- attack leads to defense; we don't want that
- understand that errors are not attacks on the person, just facts that have to be uncovered

*We definitely see it in our SoftDev class - by sharing our code, we know how to improve our own code and also find the best way of tackling the problem
*Additionally, having someone read over your code improves your ability to explain your code.
*You have to be open to critique to become better.
**It makes coding more interesting!!!
