- data modeling with MongoDB allows you to improve the application and data model at the same time
- daâ€ a model is defined at the application level
- steps
    1. evaluate the application workload (data size, operations, database indexes)
    2. map out entities and their relationships (should we link or embed data?)
    3. finalize the data model for each collection
- linked relationships = one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many lets you refer to info from other data sets (ex: application that has users has links to their data)
- embed means putting more data within a certain set of data
- schema versioning pattern (resolves the problem have reading different formats/versions of data)
