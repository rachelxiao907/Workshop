Team F^2: 
- This trio used "INSERT INTO <table> VALUES(?, ?, ?)", and then typed c.execute(command, <value1>, <value2>, <value3>) 
	- Helps avoid concatenation, which makes the code easier to read

Team Selective Soup: 
- When reading in the file, they used a with open block
- f strings make the code easier to read (no concatenation)
- f"""
            INSERT INTO courses VALUES
              ({repr(row['code'])},
               {row['mark']},
               {row['id']})
        """
  { } allows us to use exactly what's in the brackets
  The function repr to add quotes around a String variable, making a printable representational string

Team Three Coffee Peanuts: 
- Added the information into two tables, one for each csv file. 
- If the table already exists, they'd add to the existing table
	- If we open the database twice, then there may be duplicate values 
- If the table did not exist, they'd create a new table

Other Equally Cool Teams: 
- c.fetchall() was used to access all of the data in the database.
	- When printing the results of c.fetchall(), it lets us see the content of the tables
	- The function creates a list for each row
