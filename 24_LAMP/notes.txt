SSH keys
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys

In the Digital Ocean Console:
- Added users and add them as sudoers: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-sudo-enabled-user-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart
- Install pip: apt install python3-pip
- Install venv: apt install python3.8-venv
- Install Flask: pip install Flask
- Update: sudo apt update
- Install Apache: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04
                  sudo apt install apache2
                  sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
- Added ssh keys for each computer that will need to access the droplet:
    1) Copy your ssh public key from your local computer (github link above) 
    2) Launch the Droplet console and switch to the user that you will be working as (ie su hebe)
    3) cd into the root directory: cd ~
    4) if the .ssh directory exists:
          cd into .ssh then paste your ssh key into the end of the authorized_keys file
       if .ssh directory does not exist:
          mkdir .ssh
          cd .ssh
          create authorized_keys and paste your ssh key there
- Be in root when adding users
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04
  - ssh root@your_server_ip
  - adduser <user>
  - Make the user a superuser so they can use sudo commands 
    usermod -aG sudo <user>
  - User will be prompted to enter information like password or phone numbers (can be left blank)
  - ssh <user>@<server_ip> for SSH access
